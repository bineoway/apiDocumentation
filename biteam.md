  The Neoway BI team can provide you a great range of service solutions. We can build Business Intelligence aplications and we also can provide you data through a Restful API service.

#### BI APLICATIONS

We have a specialized team of Customer Success that can help you to identify and specify your business's needs.
Once we have a specification document defined the BI Team will analyse it and build a DataCloud by an ETL process to design professional dashboards and reports to support your decisions make.

Currently we work with the following BI tools:

* QlikView
* PowerBI
* Pentaho
