### BI APLICATIONS

<p class="message">
We have a specialized team of Customer Success that can help you to identify and specify your business's needs.
</p>

Once we have a specification document defined the BI Team will analyze it and build a DataCloud by an ETL process to design professional dashboards and reports to support your decisions make.

Currently, we work with the following BI tools:

* QlikView
* PowerBI
* Pentaho

Neoway is a Company specialized in Big Data, therefore, we have a huge number of different data sources. For example:

* Personal Data (Individual / Natural Person)
* Legal Entities
* Vehicle

It means the BI Team can merge these data with your company's data or scenario and show you spec√≠fic aspects of your business that you could not see clearly before.


### BI API

<p class="message">
Let's suppose you want to be free to analyze the data how and whenever you decide to. You do not want to ask us to change a specific BI Application and wait to see the results. 
</p>

Thinking about this scenario we developed a complete Restful API so that you can extract the data and build your own analysis.

The BI Team and the CS Team will help you to define what data is important to you. Once we have this definition we can build a customized schema to provide you these data.

In order to make it easier you can check the following guide to learn how to interact with this API.
