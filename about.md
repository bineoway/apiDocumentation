<p class="message">
  Hey there! Here you can learn more about what Neoway BI API can do for your company. Carry on!
</p>

BI API is a Restful API microservice built with nodejs and it works like a charm.

Let's suppose you want to be free to analyze the data when and how you decide. So that we created the BI API. 

You can extract the data using our Node.JS extractor or our QlikView extractor and use any tool to analyze these data such as Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, QlikView, Pentaho, Talend and so.

If you do not want to use one of our extractors you can build your own extractor.

Generally, all you have to do is to make a GET request with a pagination method such as a loop structure "for, while". You can follow the concept of our two extractors, but we recommend you to use our Node.JS extractor.

Go to the [requests](https://neowaycx.github.io/BIApiDocumentation/requests) page and learn how to use this microservice to get the data.

We have to say, *It is Amazing!*.
Enjoy!
