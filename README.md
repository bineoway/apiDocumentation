## Neoway

We solve real problems for companies that need to sell more and lose less.

We use Big Data as a tool for discovering market opportunities, empowering nontechnical users to navigate massive databases, and making strategic data-driven decisions more confidently.

## Guide Layout

Lanyon is a theme built on top of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup—just download and start the Jekyll server. See [the Poole usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to install and use Jekyll.
